### Day 2: March 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did some more Codewars exercises.

**Thoughts:** For a couple of the exercises felt like I was onto what I needed to do pretty quickly, still took a bit to figure out how to implement that though.

### Day 4: March 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: (1) Did a couple Codewars exercises; (2) Wrote a bit of code to take rows out of a sqlite database of notes I have and write them a markdown file as something I might want to integrate into a little personal tool; (3) 

**Thoughts:** Had fun but want more meat on the bone, think I want to start digging into a project and solving things related to that.

### Day 5: March 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More of a learn by watching day than a learn by writing code day,  though I did write some lines. Was mostly focused on thinking about how to plan out the project that I want to tackle over the next 95 days. So read about how people go about planning coding projects and then used those suggestions and techniques to start brainstorming about the first steps for my own project.

### Day 6: March 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Decided that I wanted to have my little note app be a flask web app so set up the bare bones of a flask app to start learning about Flask in general and to have that done for when I actually want to add functionality.

### Day 7: March 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Flask app some more -- got through the tutorial I was following so now I have a little CRUD app that I can built on top of. Did a bit of work on a pandas script as well for Kabyle work.

### Day 8: March 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Flask app frontend a bit more, mostly CSS changes. Also followed another Flask app turtial to try a different approach. Played around with MongoDB some just to learn about it. Did some more pandas work for the Kabyle verb project.

### Day 9: March 11, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Wanted to see if I could implement the same app that I had already done with a MongoDB backend and figured out how to do that! Feeling good, though undirected.

### Day 10: March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Flask notes app, which now has a name, Jot. Now has full CRUD functionality for the top level notes and the ability to insert subnotes ("jots") into notes. Still going with MongoDB backend. Also practiced some HTML/CSS along the way! Still feeling a bit undirected.

### Day 11: March 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Decided to go back to basics and start [this course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) for the remainder of the challenge. Got mostly caught up to day 11.
